# MinecraftConnect

A quick plugin made just for posting information easily to a webhook. Compatible with Discord, Slack, and others. 

## Installation
- Download the .jar file from the repo. Click the .jar file on the root of the repo and download it.     
- Place this file in the plugins folder of your server (spigot, paper, etc).    
- Run the server, then kill it. The config.yml file will be generated in a folder called MinecraftConnect.    
- Open the file, and add your webhook url near the top (will be labeled in the file), save, and restart your server.    
- If it doesn't work, check that your server has internet connection and that you saved the webhook in your discord settings.
